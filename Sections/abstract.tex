This thesis presents a search for light charged Higgs bosons in rare top quark decays using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138~\fbinv at 13~\TeV and 62~\fbinv at 13.6~\TeV. The search targets the decay chain $\PQt \to \PHc\PQb$, followed by $\PHc \to \PWp\PA$ and $\PA \to \Pgmp\Pgmm$, where \PHc is the charged Higgs boson and \PA is a CP-odd Higgs boson predicted by Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDM). The final state consists of three charged leptons ($\Pe\Pgm\Pgm$ or $\Pgm\Pgm\Pgm$), missing transverse momentum, and at least two jets including one b-tagged jet. The search covers charged Higgs boson masses($\mHc$) from 70 to 160\GeV and CP-odd Higgs boson masses($\mA$) from 15\GeV to $\mHc - 5\GeV$, including off-shell $\PHc \to \PWp\PA$ decays. A ParticleNet-based classifier is used to discriminate signal from \PZ boson backgrounds, and signal is extracted using a binned maximum likelihood fit to the dimuon invariant mass distribution. No statistically significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed, and upper limits at 95\% confidence level are set on the signal branching ratio. This result represents the first search for the decay $\PHc \to \PW\PA$ including off-shell effects.
